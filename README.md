# Exercise-Tracker-App-Java
The Exercise Tracker application allows the user to input their daily exercise sessions so that they can track their progress and physical activity on a daily basis. Users would need to create a new account (with a username and password) and store their information (goals and exercise sessions), so they will know how they ended up doing. They will be able to log out and log back into the application to update and check their progress (they need to enter the correct login information in order to do this)s. This application allows the user to set and edit daily exercise goals, so that it helps them with their progress and helps them improve from their previous exercise sessions.
